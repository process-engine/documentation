# Internal messagebus communication

The internal messagebus communication describes what messages are used by the process-engine to
talk to other parts of itself or other instances of the process engine.

These messages are only interesting if you develop the process-engine stack itself. If you just
want to use the process-engine, refer to the [external messagebus communication](../external/README.md)
