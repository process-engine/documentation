is the problem at hand?\nMany companies document how things are supposed to be done in diagrams, which are a great way to plan, define and coordinate procedures.\nThe problem is, that making sure they are actually used costs time and energy,\nso in reality they often vanish in a drawer somewhere.\nWhat do we do about it?\nWe want you to view a BPMN process as more than a simple document. It's like a set of instructions, describing what you want a software to do for you. Instead of manually executing a BPMN process you can rely on the process engine to do that for you.\nAll you need to do is to feed it some metadata that you can easily configure using our Web UI and you're good to go.\nWhat are your benefits of using the process engine?\n\nget from plan to execution in a fraction of the usual time\nrun multiple versions of the same process in parallel\nuse existing infrastructure\nadapt your BPMN processes on the fly\nwork with an extremly scalable and flexible solution that suits even the most complicated setups\n\nBPMN\nThis documentation will try to explain certain aspects of BPMN that are necessary for understanding our implementations.\nHowever BPMN is a large standard and it is not in the scope of this documentation to explain all of that.\nYou can find extensive materials at its official standards committee.\n"},"see-it-in-action.html":{"url":"see-it-in-action.html","title":"See it in action","keywords":"","body":"See it in action\n"},"quick-start/":{"url":"quick-start/","title":"Quick Start","keywords":"","body":"Quick Start\nDuring the course of this quick start guide you will learn how to model simple use cases using the process engine.\nWe will take a look at how to model the BPMN process itself using the BPMN standard. In further steps we will integrate the BPMN process with the process engine so that we can execute it.\nOur goal with this quick start guide is to create a whole BPMN process step by step.\nThe resulting BPMN process will look something like this:\n\n"},"quick-start/setup.html":{"url":"quick-start/setup.html","title":"Setup","keywords":"","body":"Setup\nBefore we start using the process engine you need to install it on your machine.\nYou can start by cloning the skeleton repository. It contains a minimal setup of the process engine that you can use right away.\ngit clone git@github.com:ProcessEngineJS/skeleton.git\nThe repository consists of two parts:\n\na docker container with the process engine database \nthe process engine server\n\nThe skeleton repository contains a README.md that explains the detailed steps required to run the process engine.\n\nNote: you have to start the database before you start the process engine server.\n\nIf you successfully started the process engine you can view the web UI at http://localhost:8000/app.\nProcess Manager\nYou can view a list of all processes by clicking on the Demo-dropdown at the top and selecting ProzessManager.\n\n"},"quick-start/hands-on/":{"url":"quick-start/hands-on/","title":"Hands-On","keywords":"","body":"Hands on!\nIn this part, you'll quickly learn the basics of handling the process-engine.\nWe start with a simple hello-world example, then move on to consuming an API and finally sending mails with conditions.\nThe final process will look like this:\n\n"},"quick-start/hands-on/hello-world.html":{"url":"quick-start/hands-on/hello-world.html","title":"Hello World","keywords":"","body":"Hello World\nLet's start with the all time classic example Hello World.\nWe want to execute a BPMN diagram with a single user task, that will look like this:\n\nThis user task will show us the Hello World message as well as a confirm dialog to end the task. \nCreating a new diagram\nOpen the process manager and click on the +-button on the top left to create a new process.\nYou need to specify the name of the process and the key used to reference the diagram.\nFor now, let's just use Hello World for both.\nDouble clicking the newly created diagram will get you into the detail view.\n\nModeling the diagram\nYou can now see the BPMN editor showing your diagram with only a lane and a start event.\nWhen selecting an element, you can create new elements that are already connected to the selected one by using the context-menu.\n\nLooks fine so far, but the process still needs to be made executable.\nIntegrating the diagram\n\nTODO: The role has to be set to guest. This needs to be documented\n\nIf we want the process engine to render a UI, it needs to know what we want the UI to look like.\nWe can specify that with key/value pairs by using the Extensions panel on the right side of the editor.\nSetting uiName tells the process engine what kind of UI component we want to use. For now, a confirm dialog is a good example.\nSetting uiConfig specifies the details for the UI component - in this case the message and buttons to display.\n${ \"message\": \"Hello World!\", \"layout\": [ { \"key\": \"confirm\", \"label\": \"OK\" } ] };\n\n\nNow we configured what the user task should look like in the UI - time to

this example we'll fetch data of currency exchange rates from a REST API and display the fetched data.\nCreate a new diagram, just like in the Hello World example.\nAfter that, create a service task

explanation of what those settings do in the Frontend Documentation.\n\n\nNext, we tell the flow how the result is to be interpreted and forwarded to the user task.\nThe flow mapping will restructure how the result data of the previous task is persisted in the process token.\nJSON.parse(token.current.result).rates.USD\n\nIn this case we don't want to use all the exchange rates we retrieved, but only the USD rates.\nAfter the mapping, the next BPMN node after the flow can use the USD rate by accessing token.current. \n\nYou can find a detailed explanation of the flow mappings in the Frontend Documentation.\n\n\nAt last, we tell the user task what to display (again, in the Extensions-panel)\nBy using Confirm as the uiName we can choose a confirm dialog and supply a uiConfig to the

You certainly have a static configuration you could change to adjust the port. But especially when your application is controlled by another application (e.g. an orchestrator), you want to be able to adjust it without changing the static configuration. Instead you could use environment variables or command-line arguments.\nOur configuration concept uses a configuration hierarchy. All the configuration values inside that hierarchy can be set from multiple configuration sources that overwrite one another in a distinct order.\nThis is the overwrite-order, descending by priority:\n\ndynamic configuration\ncommand-line arguments\nenvironment variables\nstatic configuration\n\nUsage\nAny configuration you declared will be automatically injected into the config property of the corresponding class.\nThis injection happens right after class instantiation so that you can expect and use the configuration object everywhere except in the constructor.\nclass ExampleService {\n  public config: any = undefined;\n  public doSomething(): void {\n    console.log(this.config.myValue); // 'test'\n  }\n}\n\nDeclaration\nThe declaration of a configuration object is done during registration of classes on the IoC container (see Dependency Injection).\ncontainer.register('ExampleService', ExampleService)\n  .configure('example:example_service');\n\nIn this example the configuration declaration is example:example_service.\nNaming Convention\nThe naming convention allows you to specify the object hierarchy of your configuration objects, separated by a spacer - in this case :.\nOur example from before has two layers that make up its hierarchy - example and example_service.\nThe following sections will explore how these hierarchies are represented across different configuration sources.\nStatic Configuration\nMost of your application configuration will be static. Static configuration is provided as a single configuration file OR as multiple configuration files inside a configuration folder.\nConfiguration File\nIf the static configuration is provided within a single JSON file, the hierarchy layers will be represented as knodes of that JSON file.\nIn this example our JSON file could look like this:\n{\n  \"example\": {\n    \"example_service\": {\n      \"myValue\": \"test\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nBy default the configuration file is expected to be ./config.json in your project root.\n\nConfiguration Folder\nThe configuration folder uses the same structure as the configuration file. It just splits the structure up across multiple files and folders.\nIn our example the file structure would look like this:\n.\n+-- config\n    +-- example\n        +-- example_service.json\nand the content of example_service.json like this:\n{\n  \"myValue\": \"test\"\n}\nIf you compare this with the Configuration File, the difference is that you have smaller, more atomic configuration files that might be easier to maintain for you.\n\nBy default the configuration folder is expected to be ./config in your project root.\n\nEnvironment Configuration\nIn case you want to set a configuration value with an environment variable the spacer for hierarchy layers is __.\nSticking to our example, we would set the value like this:\nexport example__example_service__myValue=test\n\nNote: this is how you would set the environment variable in a Linux environment. The syntax differs across operating systems.\n\nCommand Line Arguments\nWhen using command line arguments the hierarchy layers are used as in the declaration.\nnode myApp --example:example_service:myValue test\nAdditional arguments can simply be supplied by appending another argument using the same syntax.\nDynamic Configuration\nIn contrast to all other configuration sources, the dynamic configuration is the only source that is evaluated during runtime.\nThis gives you flexibility for advanced scenarios like fetching configuration from a network source or conditional configuration elements.\nThe dynamic configuration is implemented by using a Resolver from addict-ioc.\nYou can use resolvers to provide a dynamic configuration on several layers, overwriting one another in descending order:\n\na class\nmultiple classes\nall classes registered to the IoC container\n\nAdditionally you can even overwrite these at runtime by using a factory supplying it as an extra parameter to the resolve-method of the IoC container or to the factory function when working with a lazy dependency. \n"},"community/":{"url":"community/","title":"Community","keywords":"","body":"Community\n"},"roadmap.html":{"url":"roadmap.html","title":"Roadmap","keywords":"","body":"Roadmap\nOpen Source Release\nCommercial Release\n"},"faq.html":{"url":"faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\n"},"troubleshooting.html":{"url":"troubleshooting.html","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"Troubleshooting\n"},"GLOSSARY.html":{"url":"GLOSSARY.html","keywords":"","body":"bridge\nBridges are used to tie together different technologies in a loosely-coupled fashion.\nSee also: Bridges.\nadapter\nSee Adapters.\nintegrate\nIntegrating a BPMN process means configuring a regular BPMN process to be executable by the process engine.\ninversion of control\nInversion of control is the idea behind dependency injection.
