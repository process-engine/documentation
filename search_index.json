is the problem at hand?\nMany companies document how things are supposed to be done in diagrams. They\nare a great way to plan, define and coordinate procedures.\nThe problem is, that making sure they are actually used costs time and energy,\nso in reality they often vanish in a drawer somewhere.\nWhat do we do about it?\nWe want you to view a BPMN process as more than a simple document. It's like a set of instructions, describing what you want a software to do for you. Instead of manually executing a BPMN process you can rely on the process engine to do that for you.\nThe process engine gives you the power to execute BPMN diagrams of yours as integral part of the software. All you need to do is to feed it some metadata that you can easily configure using our Web UI and you're good to go.\nWhat are your benefits of using the process engine?\n\nget from plan to execution in a fraction of the usual time\nrun multiple versions of the same process in parallel\nuse existing infrastructure\nadapt your BPMN processes on the fly\nwork with an extremly scalable and flexible solution that suits even the most complicated setups\n\n"},"see-it-in-action.html":{"url":"see-it-in-action.html","title":"See it in action","keywords":"","body":"See it in action\n"},"quick-start/":{"url":"quick-start/","title":"Quick Start","keywords":"","body":"Quick Start\nDuring the course of this quick start guide you will learn how to model simple use cases using the process engine.\nWe will take a look at how to model the BPMN process itself using the BPMN standard. In further steps we will integrate the BPMN process with the process engine so that we can execute it.\nOur goal with this quick start guide is to create a whole BPMN process step by step.\nThe resulting BPMN process will look something like this:\n"},"quick-start/setup.html":{"url":"quick-start/setup.html","title":"Setup","keywords":"","body":"Setup\nBefore we start using the process engine you need to install it on your machine.\nYou can start by cloning the skeleton repository. It contains a minimal setup of the process engine that you can use right away.\ngit clone git@github.com:ProcessEngineJS/skeleton.git\nThe repository consists of two parts:\n\na docker container with the process engine database \nthe process engine server\n\nThe skeleton repository contains a README.md that explains the detailed steps required to run the process engine.\n\nNote: you have to start the database before you start the process engine server.\n\nIf you successfully started the process engine you can view the web UI at http://localhost:8000/app.\nProcess Manager\nYou can view a list of all processes by clicking on the Demo-dropdown at the top and selecting ProzessManager.\n\n"},"quick-start/hands-on.html":{"url":"quick-start/hands-on.html","title":"Hands-On","keywords":"","body":"Hands on!\nIn this part, you'll quickly learn the basics of handling the process-engine.\nWe start with a simple hello-world, then move on to consuming an API, and finally send a mail with a condition.\nThe final process will look like this:\n\n"},"quick-start/hands-on/hello-world.html":{"url":"quick-start/hands-on/hello-world.html","title":"Hello World","keywords":"","body":"Hello World\nLet's start with the all time classic example Hello World.\nWe want to execute a BPMN diagram with a single user task, that will look like this:\n\nThis user task will show us the Hello World message as well as a confirm dialog to end the task. \nCreating a new diagram\nOpen the process manager and click on the +-button on the top left to create a new process.\nYou need to specify the name of the process and the key used to reference the diagram.\nFor now, let's just use Hello World for both.\nDouble clicking the newly created diagram will get you into the detail view.\n\nModeling the diagram\nYou can now see the BPMN editor showing your diagram with only a lane and a start event.\nWhen selecting an element, you can create new elements that are already connected to the selected one by using the context-menu.\n\nLooks fine so far, but the process still needs to be made executable.\nIntegrating the diagram\n\nTODO: The role has to be set to guest. This needs to be documented\n\nIf we want the process engine to render a UI, it needs to know what we want the UI to look like.\nWe can specify that with key/value pairs by using the Extensions panel on the right side of the editor.\nSetting uiName tells the process engine what kind of UI component we want to use. For now, a confirm dialog is a good example.\nSetting uiConfig specifies the details for the UI component - in this case the message and buttons to display.\n\nNow we configured what the user task should look like in the UI - time to execute!\n\n"},"quick-start/hands-on/consuming-rest-api.html":{"url":"quick-start/hands-on/consuming-rest-api.html","title":"Consuming a REST

then send a mail with the conversion-rate to the specified email-address\nTo achieve this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n0:00 - 0:09 Rename the process to Sending mails\n0:10 - 0:17 Increase the lane-size, so we have more playroom\n0:18 - 1:14 Add a form to ask for an email address\n1:17 - 1:20 Give the Fetch Data task an id, so we can use its result later\n1:22 - 1:27 Remove a mapper that we no longer need\n1:12 - 1:54 Update the Show Data task (Send Data in the Video) to become Confirm Data\n1:55 - 2:05 Add a gateway so we can either send the mail on ok or abort on cancel\n2:06 - 3:10 Add the Send email Service-Task\n3:15 - 3:52 Configure the gateway-flows, so that ok will send the mail, and cancel will abort\n\n\nThese are the copy-pasted values in the video:\n// uiConfig for \"Confirm Data\"\n${ \"message\": \"1 EUR = \" + JSON.parse(token.history.fetch_data.result).rates.USD + \" USD - email: \" + token.current.email, \"layout\": [ { \"key\": \"confirm\", \"label\":

If the user task is about to be executed, the process engine will continue the execution on a process engine client where a call center agent is logged in. If you got another role for a call center supervisor you could use that to mark tasks that only a supervisor is allowed to handle and it will only be executed on a client where a supervisor is logged in. \nGateways\nA gateway can be used to model conditional execution paths.

Each process engine uses its own data model and exposes it in a generic datastore. This data model can be queried against using the HTTP REST API, GraphQL or the Client API (via Messagebus).\nApps\nBesides the process engine you might have several other machines - e.g. a client pc next to a production line or a server running archiving jobs. Those could be part of your business processes as well and the process engine can make them work as a part of the process execution.\nClients\nYour business processes will most likely contain manual user tasks at some point. A user can log into the process engine frontend in the browser and take care of these tasks. The UI will be automatically generated based on the preferences in the business process.\nTypical Setups\nSingle Server\nIn a setup with a single process engine server, this server:\n\nKnows database servers relevant to BPMN processes\nKnows other servers that may play a part in a BPMN process\nServes all the clients running the process engine frontend\n\n\nMultiple Servers\n\nWhen running multiple process engine servers, each server:\n\nKnows some or all of the database servers relevant to BPMN processes\nKnows some or all other servers that may play a part in a BPMN process\nServes some clients running the process engine frontend\nThis is usually split by a load balancer (or by use cases in a heterogeneous setup (see 2.2.2 Heterogeneous Setup))\n\n\n\nHomogeneous Setup\nIn a homogeneous server setup each of the process engine servers is deployed with the same components and has access to the same ressources.\nThis makes scaling the system easy, because you can scale it by increasing the number of the machines running the process engine.\nHeterogeneous Setup\nIn a heterogeneous server setup you have multiple servers running the process engine. But each of the servers can have different components or ressources. That means not every instance can perform every action. Instead if a system cannot execute the request action, it will hand it off to another process engine server that is capable of executing it.\nSupported Technology\nEnvironments\nThe libraries that form the process engine are isomorphic wherever possible. But there will always be use cases where an environment cannot provide an adequate fallback - e.g. a browser won't provide access to the file system or network ports.\nIn cases like this the environment-specific parts are encapsulated into a separate library so that there is a library - containing only the isomorphic core functionality - that can be executed in every environment.  \n\nNode.js (Windows, Linux, OS X)\nBrowser (every browser that supports ECMAScript 5 or higher)\n\nTo clarify: yes, the whole process engine stack can run in the browser as well - including data layer, access management and process execution\nDatabase Adapters\nThe data layer is abstracted in the process engine so that the same data model can be used to consume a relational database and an object database.\n\nPostgres\nMongoDB\nOrientDB\nRedis\nLocal Storage\n\nSpecial Adapters\nRather than building a bridge to a database technology, special adapters aim to provide a different way to work with the data layer.\n\nProxy\nUses another process engine instance as a database adapter remotely\n\n\nIn Memory\nStores data in memory without directly persisting it\n\n\n\nMessagebus Adapters\nThe messagebus uses a channel-name-based pub/sub pattern. This is the only thing a messagebus has to support in order to be compatible to the process engine.\nCurrently implemented adapters:\n\nFaye\n\nUnsupported Technology\nIn the previous section you learned which adapters to other technologies we already provide. This list will grow over time.\nIf you need an adapter for a technology that is not yet supported, you have several options:\nPlace your request in the backlog\nYou can open an issue in our backlog on Github. We will try to priorize the issue based on the popularity and demand of the technology and the progress of our roadmap.\nChoosing this way is the easiest for you, but will also take the longest time to completion.\nWrite your own\nAlthough writing you own adapters requires some basic knowledge of the process engine, most of the interfaces are rather self explanatory.\nYou can find in-depth guides on writing your own adapters here: TODO: link \nPay us to do it for you\nThe process engine is not just the product of a single company. It is the shared vision of a network of multiple companies.\nAs such we offer custom implementations and consulting through our company network.\nIf you have a request, please send a mail to TODO: link for further information.\n"},"reference/stack/":{"url":"reference/stack/","title":"Stack","keywords":"","body":"Stack\nWhen we refer to the stack we're talking about a collection of loosely coupled modules.\nEach module has a certain topic and should only have responsibilities for tasks associated with that topic.\nThese modules are regular npm packages that can be dependent from one another.\n"},"reference/stack/structure.html":{"url":"reference/stack/structure.html","title":"Structure","keywords":"","body":"Structure\nEach module can be placed inside a category.

When dealing with a stack of this size we need to make sure that every component is exchangable through dependency injection without changing the code.\nImagine we have a class ReportingService in a module reporting that depends on the class LoggingService from the module logging.\nThe npm package reporting would not have a dependency on logging, but rather on logging_contracts.\nAlso the class ReportingService would not reference the class LoggingService. Instead it uses the interface ILoggingService from logging_contracts.\n\nNow that the reporting module has no references to the implementation, we can completely change the implementation through dependency injection as long as our replacement fulfills the contract (implements the interface).\nBridges\nWhen we need to tie one base module to another we want to do it in a way that keeps them loosely coupled. This means that the implementations we tied together are completely independent from one another.\nWe achieve the loose coupling by putting all the glue that ties modules together into bridge modules.\nOne example you will often find are http-bridges. Normally base module mostly contain services that encapsulate logic.\nIf we want to expose service logic via a HTTP endpoint we have to define which HTTP routes and methods can be used to execute the service logic. The code that does this resides in the bridge module.\n\nUsually bridge modules are discovered using Inversion of Control (see 3.1).\nAdapters\nAdapters are very similar to bridges, but have one important difference. They provide the glue needed to tie a base implementation of our stack to a third party component or technology outside of our stack.\nThe prime example for this are the data source adapters used in our stack.\nFor each third party database technology we want to support, we need an adapter that knows how our generic data layer can be tied to the database so that both will work together. \n\nExtensions\nThe entry point for the whole stack is the AppBootstrapper. It uses the ExtensionBootstrapper to discover extensions. After discovering them the ExtensionBootstrapper has two phases. First it initializes all extensions by calling the initialize-method. Then it starts them by calling the start-method.\nWhen the two phases have completed and the bootstrapper is done, the application is considered as started.\nAlthough extensions are technically suited for all kinds of uses we solely use them to represent the communication endpoints of an application.\nFor example, the HttpExtension starts a HTTP server and discovers components that can register routes on the HTTP server. An AmqpExtension could do something similar to that with the AMQP protocol.\n\n"},"reference/stack/module-interaction.html":{"url":"reference/stack/module-interaction.html","title":"Module Interaction","keywords":"","body":"Module Interaction\nWhen using a stack with so many classes we will have classes that depend on other classes to do their job. There will likely be a whole lot of such dependencies so that we need a uniform way of dealing with them to prevent chaos.\nWe achieve this by using an IoC container that we register all dependencies to. \nThe result of all registrations is what we call the dependency graph.\nDependency Graph\n\nWhenever we need a class instance we will let the IoC container take care of instantiating it and resolving its dependencies.\nIf you're not used to the inversion of control pattern you might see this as an overhead. But it is just the opposite.\nExcept from places where you're dealing with highly dynamic dependencies, all classes will be instantiated because they are a dependency to another class.\nThat results in cleaner, easy-to-maintain code and enables us to use additional features based on the dependency graph.\nDependency Injection\nWe use addict-ioc as our IoC container.\nA detailed documentation can be found on its GitHub page.\nWe use the constructor injection to inject dependencies into instances.\nIoC Modules\nOur stack is split up into modules. When we build an application from those modules we might want one application to use all of the modules while another application only needs a part of those modules.\nFor clear separation of the modules we decided to organize each modules registrations to the IoC container inside its own module.\nBy convention you can find this module in the root folder as ioc_module.js.\n\nWhen the ioc_module.js is registered to the IoC container it is expected to register everything that module has to offer.\nBut there are use cases where you want to overwrite certain module classes with your own. In such cases you want more granular control over which registrations of the module are loaded.\nNext to the ioc_module.js you will find files like ioc.services.js or ioc.entity_types.js.\nThose files - let's call them IoC parts - contain just a certain category of registrations.\nThe ioc_module.js is responsible to load all IoC parts so that the person or program using the module does not have to know its IoC parts to load it.\nDiscovery\nWhenever there is a dynamic branch in our dependency graph we use a discovery mechanism that is based on the registrations on the IoC container.\n\nIn this example the DataModel has a dependency on the container (which is the IoC container instance itself) and among others it has a dynamic dependency on entities. The dependency graph is not aware that the DataModel uses entities, the DataModel just asks the container for all registrations that are tagged as an entity.\nWith this mechanism the number of entities can vary amongst applications without the need of changing the underlying code.\nThe current discoveries are:\n\n\n\nDiscovery Tag\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n Schema\nJSON Schemas based on the TypeScript Definitions\n\n\n Entity\nClasses derived from the Entity base class the generic EntityType consumes\n\n\n Router\nClasses derived from the RouterBase base class the HttpExtension consumes\n\n\n Extension\nClasses following the extension pattern of the bootstrapper\n\n\n TokenAdapter\nClasses implementing the ITokenAdapter interface the TokenService consumes \n\n\n FeatureGenerator\nClasses following the generator pattern of the FeatureService\n\n\n\n"},"reference/stack/basic-concepts/":{"url":"reference/stack/basic-concepts/","title":"Basic Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Basic Concepts\nThe basic concepts explain patterns and implementations that are critical to understanding how the stack works.

In most cases you only need to specify what type you want to use to represent it in the database. The type can be either one of the options of the enum SchemaAttributeType or a string if you want to use one of your own types (e.g. other entities).\nEntity Methods\nEach public method you implement (except initialize) should accept the ExecutionContext as one of its parameters. The execution context is used to track information for access management. \nWhen calling other entities or services you are likely to need the ExecutionContext at some point anyway.\nTechnically this is not necessary as long as you don't use the parameter, but it is considered a best practice to avoid changing method signatures afterwards.\nIf you plan to execute a method via our HTTP REST API, it is mandatory to include the ExecutionContext in the method signature.\n"},"reference/stack/basic-concepts/entity-services.html":{"url":"reference/stack/basic-concepts/entity-services.html","title":"Entity Services","keywords":"","body":"Entity Services\nEntity services are a supplement to entities.

You certainly have a static configuration you could change to adjust the port. But especially when your application is controled by another application (e.g. an orchestrator), you want to be able to adjust it without changing the static configuration. Instead you could use environment variables or command-line arguments.\nOur configuration concept uses a configuration hierarchy. All the configuration values inside that hierarchy can be set from multiple configuration sources that overwrite one another in a distinct order.\nThis is the overwrite-order, descending by priority:\n\ndynamic configuration\ncommand-line arguments\nenvironment variables\nstatic configuration\n\nUsage\nAny configuration you declared will be automatically injected into the config property of the corresponding class.\nThis injection happens right after class instantiation so that you can expect and use the configuration object everywhere except in the constructor.\nclass ExampleService {\n  public config: any = undefined;\n  public doSomething(): void {\n    console.log(this.config.myValue); // 'test'\n  }\n}\n\nDeclaration\nThe declaration of a configuration object is done during registration of classes on the IoC container (see Dependency Injection).\ncontainer.register('ExampleService', ExampleService)\n  .configure('example:example_service');\n\nIn this example the configuration declaration is example:example_service.\nNaming Convention\nThe naming convention allows you to specify the object hierarchy of your configuration objects, separated by a spacer - in this case :.\nOur example from before has two layers that make up its hierarchy - example and example_service.\nThe following sections will explore how these hierarchies are represented across different configuration sources.\nStatic Configuration\nMost of your application configuration will be static. Static configuration is provided within a single or multiple configuration files.\nConfiguration File\nIf the static configuration is provided within a single JSON file, the hierarchy layers will be represented as knodes of that JSON file.\nIn this example our JSON file could look like this:\n{\n  \"example\": {\n    \"example_service\": {\n      \"myValue\": \"test\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nConfiguration Folder\nThe configuration folder uses the same structure as the configuration file. It just splits the structure up across multiple files and folders.\nIn our example the file structure would look like this:\n.\n+-- config\n    +-- example\n        +-- example_service.json\nand the content of example_service.json like this:\n{\n  \"myValue\": \"test\"\n}\nIf you compare this with the Configuration File, the difference is that you have smaller, more atomic configuration files that might be easier to maintain for you.\nEnvironment Configuration\nIn case you want to set a configuration value with an environment variable the spacer for hierarchy layers is __.\nSticking to our example, we would set the value like this:\nexport example__example_service__myValue=test\n\nNote: this is how you would set the environment variable in a Linux environment. The syntax differs across operating systems.\n\nCommand Line Arguments\nWhen using command line arguments the hierarchy layers are used as in the declaration.\nnode myApp --example:example_service:myValue test\nAdditional arguments can simply be supplied by appending another argument using the same syntax.\nDynamic Configuration\nIn contrast to all other configuration sources, the dynamic configuration is the only source that is evaluated during runtime.\nThis gives you flexibility for advanced scenarios like fetching configuration from a network source or conditional configuration elements.\nThe dynamic configuration is implemented by using a Resolver from addict-ioc.\nYou can use resolvers to provide a dynamic configuration on several layers, overwriting one another in descending order:\n\na class\nmultiple classes\nall classes registered to the IoC container\n\nAdditionally you can even overwrite these at runtime by using a factory supplying it as an extra parameter to the resolve-method of the IoC container or to the factory function when working with a lazy dependency. \n"},"community/":{"url":"community/","title":"Community","keywords":"","body":"Community\n"},"roadmap.html":{"url":"roadmap.html","title":"Roadmap","keywords":"","body":"Roadmap\nOpen Source Release\nCommercial Release\n"},"faq.html":{"url":"faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\n"},"troubleshooting.html":{"url":"troubleshooting.html","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"Troubleshooting\n"},"GLOSSARY.html":{"url":"GLOSSARY.html","keywords":"","body":"bridge\nBridges are used to tie together different technologies in a loosely-coupled fashion.\nSee also: Bridges.\nadapter\nSee Adapters.\nintegrate\nIntegrating a BPMN process means configuring a regular BPMN process to be executable by the process engine.\ninversion of control\nInversion of control is the idea behind dependency injection.
