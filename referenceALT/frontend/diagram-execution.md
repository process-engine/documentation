# Diagram Execution

When you select a diagram in the process explorer you will get to its detail view.

In this detail view you can execute the diagram by clicking the start button.

When the diagram execution reaches a user task, the generated UI for that user task will appear on top of the diagram.

If there is no frontend application connected to the process engine server when a user task is reached, the diagram execution will be paused until a frontend application is connected.
