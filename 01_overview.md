# Overview

## 1 What is the goal or problem?

Did you ever stumble upon a pile of BPMN diagrams in a drawer? If so don't worry, you're not the only one. Many companies need to sketch out their business processes into diagrams for a couple of reasons:

* they document how things are supposed to be done
* they can be reviewed (e.g. during an audit)
* they can be used to communicate changes in business processes

But the reality is, most of these diagrams are created once and then vanish in the drawer. If you want to make sure everything is done according to the BPMN process you need to ensure that yourself which requires a lot of both, time and resources.

## 2 What are we going to achieve or solve it?

We don't want you to view a BPMN process as a mere document. It's more like a template or configuration of what you want a software to do for you. Instead of manually implementing and validating a BPMN process you can rely on the process engine to do that for you.

The process engine gives you the power to execute every existing BPMN diagram of yours as if it was a software. All you need to do is to feed it some metadata that you can easily configure using out Web UI and you're good to go.

## 3 What are your benefits of using the process engine?

* you can get from plan to execution in a fraction of time compared to traditional BPMN process usage
* you can run multiple historical versions of the same process in parallel
* you can use existing infrastructure and code in your BPMN processes
* you get an extremly scalable and flexible solution that suits even the most complicated setups
  * you get a scalable solution that can grow with your business demands
  * you get an extremly flexible solution that suits even the most complicated setups and environments
