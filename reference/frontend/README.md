# Frontend

You can visit the frontend on the `/app` route of the process engine HTTP endpoint on the server.

If you run the process engine locally this would likely be `http://localhost:8000/app`.

To browse and execute diagrams you need to log in with your user credentials.

In the default setup you can log in with `admin/admin`.
