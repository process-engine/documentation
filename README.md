# Introduction

## What is the problem at hand?

Many companies document how things are supposed to be done in diagrams. They
are a great way to plan, define and coordinate procedures.

The problem is, that making sure they are actually used costs time and energy,
so in reality they often vanish in a drawer somewhere.

## What do we do about it?

We want you to view a BPMN process as more than a simple document. It's like a set of instructions, describing what you want a software to do for you. Instead of manually executing a BPMN process you can rely on the process engine to do that for you.

The process engine gives you the power to execute BPMN diagrams of yours as integral part of the software. All you need to do is to feed it some metadata that you can easily configure using our Web UI and you're good to go.

## What are your benefits of using the process engine?

* get from plan to execution in a fraction of the usual time
* run multiple versions of the same process in parallel
* use existing infrastructure
* adapt your BPMN processes on the fly
* work with an extremly scalable and flexible solution that suits even the most complicated setups

## BPMN

This documentation will try to explain certain aspects of BPMN that are necessary for understanding our implementations.

However BPMN is a large standard and it is not in the scope of this documentation to explain all of that.

You can find extensive materials at its [official standards committee](http://www.bpmn.org/).
